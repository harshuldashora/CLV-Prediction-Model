# CLV-Prediction-Model
This project predicts **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using Amazon purchase data. After cleaning and feature engineering, a machine learning pipeline with Linear Regression is trained to estimate CLV. A Flask web app lets users input customer details and instantly get predicted CLV, helping businesses improve segmentation and retention.
